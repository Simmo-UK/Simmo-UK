Hi, I`m Simmo from the uk.
I`m new here and to the coding world. i have always enjoyed computers and tech and have now started learning html,css.
I have alway been a manual worker which led me to carpul tunnel which i have had surgery on both hands.
with that being said i need a career change less power tools and vibration (lol).
I am here to learn and help and hopfully work my way into the I.T sector one way or another.
I stared looking at python and i was told that noone in the right mind would give a noob work on the backend but i would get better luck on the frontend.
Any opportunities or help rquired feel free to contact me @cryptcave@gmail.com 

Hope to see you around.
